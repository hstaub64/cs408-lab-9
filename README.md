# CS408 - Lab9.2

## Overview

In this project, we added an Evil Circle to the given bouncing ball demo.
The Evil Circles purpose is to move around via user input, eat the 
bouncing balls, and keep track of how many balls are on screen. When a 
ball is eaten by the Evil Circle, it disappears from the screen and the 
count of balls decreases.

To view the demo, make sure the live preview extension is installed and
working, before navigating to the index.html file and clicking the 
"show preview" button in the right corner. From there, you can press the
three lines in the right corner and select "open in browser" to view the 
demo in browser.
